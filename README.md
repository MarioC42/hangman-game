I wanted to see if i can build a hangman game. This might seem easy, but it is actually hard for a beginner to build. maybe even an intermediary programmer
The code is trash. But i just wanted to see if i can build this myself. And i did !!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I will try to refactor this in the future.. when i become better at JS. For now i am happy with how it turned out..

TODO - 
  [] Add Reset Button.
  [] Refactor the code
  [] Add highscore + local storage
